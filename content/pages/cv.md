## 📜 Conference Speaker bio

Software engineer in love with the open source world.

My work experience is fully in Observability: I started my career at **CERN**, monitoring extremely-large-scale distributed systems (including international computing grids) and serving the data-sciency needs of their IT department. Today, I'm part of the **Observability team at Canonical**, working on open-source solutions in the Juju ecosystem to make the wonders of great observability easily available to everyone.

Oh, and I like cute things – I really like cute things.
