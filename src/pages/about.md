I grew up in Italy 🇮🇹, but have since lived in multiple countries. I have a knack for finding new hobbies and passions, so listing all of them would make a blog of its own; however in my free time I'm mostly training (capoeira, anyone? 🤸🏻), writing, gaming, and traveling.

I **love** to work in open source :)

Currently based in Germany 🇩🇪, and trying to learn the language!

## My Background 🌲

Software engineer which sometimes wears the data scientist hat.

I majored in data science and, though my work mostly doesn't involve that, I'm still very captivated by the field. My work experience is fully in Observability, and I've had the chance to see and monitor *huuuge* deployments.

I started my career at **CERN**, monitoring extremely-large-scale distributed systems (including international computing grids) and serving the data-sciency needs of their IT department. Today, I'm part of the **Observability team at Canonical**, working on open-source solutions in the Juju ecosystem to make the wonders of good observability easily available to everyone. 

Oh, and I like cute things – I really like cute things.
